# 3. Verification and Simulation of Pauli X gate

## Name: M.Gokul
## Reg No: 24000042

## AIM:
 To verify and visualize Quantum Pauli X Gate dynamic characteristics for single qubit and
two-qubits using IBM Qiskit tool.

## Definition
Pauli X gate is a fundamental quantum gate that acts as a bit-flip operation on a quantum bit
(qubit).

## RESULT

 Pauli X gate truth table is verified using IBM Qiskit tool and compared with
theoretical calculation.

 Simulation and visualization of Pauli X gate operations are also done through IBM
Qiskit tool.
